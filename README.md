Cardboard
=========

A simple, networked card moving application made for prototyping card games. The entire thing was made in a matter of hours to be able to prototype a card game for a game design class, so don't expect much from the codebase.

That said, it should allow two people to move cards around on a board, flip them over, etc.

The game is hard coded to use port 3410, and you need [LÖVE](http://love2d.org) to play it. To launch (from within the game directory):

	love .

To connect as a client:

	love . <IP adress>
